Security Analysis, Test and Evaluation
======================================

In this section we discuss about the tasks we have done with respect to the analysis and evaluation of the security mechanisms used in the cloud infrastructure of the service providers within Glenna. When we refer to Glenna, it roughly has two components. First is the cloud infrastructure in use by the participating countries. Due to resource limitations and the different status the participating institutes were on with respect to cloud deployment and service adoption, it was not possible to make a uniform and detailed security analysis. As an alternative however we made a survey to check the state of the art in the security mechanisms of the cloud service providers by preparing a questionnaire and collect information that we found necessary for Glenna project. The questionnaire was distributed to four cloud service providers and we have received three responses. The questionnaire is annexed in the NEIC glenna wiki page and can be referred from there. 

The second component in Glenna is the mechanism used to enable federated authentication to make the available cloud services accessible to users. Within the participating cloud service providers there were two federated authentication  solutions used : 

* kalmar2: by DeIC for Data.dk service and by USIT for Lifeportal and 

* Dataporten: by UH-IaaS as a way to connect to openstack keystone module

In this way service providers make their service available by authenticating users through federated authentication solution and without users' credential within the cloud service provider's premise. In Data DeIC for instance, users can access the data storage service after authentication through kalmar2. In UH-IaaS, users can login to the openstack based cloud service through Dataporten. In both cases the federated authentication solutions are based on industry standards and users' credentials are handled in a secure manner. For more information on security in kalmar2 and Dataporten please refer to (https://www.kalmar2.org/kalmar2web/members_attchmt/appendix_A_2010_10_25.pdf)  and (https://www.uninett.no/tjenester/dataporten/personvern-og-informasjonssikkerhet).   

Security Evaluation of Cloud Service Providers in Glenna
***********************

As mentioned above we collected information about the security mechanisms of the participating cloud service providers using questionnaire. The questionnaire addresses the following domains -

* User and Access Control
* Network and System Environment
* Logs, Data and Backup
* Virtual Machines
* System and Service Security Process and Standards

In the user and access control domain, there is lack of separation between operators and users in the cloud management framework and strong password policy enforcement. Separating operators who have administrative privilege over the cloud infrastructure from normal users is an important approach to keep the balance between a security and usability. As operators or administrators have critical roles on the infrastructure, authentication to such users shall be done in a more secured manner. While enforcing such approach  on all users can make the infrastructure more secure, it will degrade the usability and affect users' experience to access the system. When it comes to password policy we suggest restrictions on password minimum length, age, history and complexity as well as stringent requirements  in actions that lead to account lockouts.

In the system environment domain it's interesting to see that all responders run the cloud service in a dedicated system which is separate from the rest of their IT services infrastructure. However, within the cloud service infrastructure there is lack of separation between sensitive and non sensitive data and production and non-production environments. Even though a separate cloud infrastructure makes the service more secure, more work needs to be done in identifying sensitive data and establish a mechanisms to threat such data in a secure manner. In addition, there is risk associated with not isolating production and non-production environments. Specially if there is a possibility for production data to fall into a non-production environment, it will put the security of the entire infrastructure into question. 

From the responses in the questions about Logs, Data and backup, there are mechanisms in place or planned to keep logs and back up of data. We suggest that the log and backup mechanisms can be more reliable if one follows approaches that are compliant to regulatory, statutory, contractual and business requirements.  When it comes to data security, none of the responders have implemented an encryption mechanism to secure tenant data at rest. With all security mechanisms in place, there is always a risk that systems can get compromised and users' and tenant data can fall in the hands of attackers. Having encryption mechanism in place will be an extra layer of security that give users more protection even after a security breach. 

In the Virtual Machines section, the questions address the major risk associated with how we incorporate virtual machines from external sources into our cloud. For a secure cloud infrastructure, a secure mechanism to manage VM is an important component. There shall be a vetting mechanism to check VMs and manage them in their entire life cycle. 

In the last section of the questionnaire we addressed issues related to system and service security process and standards. The responders mentioned they keep services and OS patched periodically however no responder has mentioned about usage of industry standards in its data security architecture. There are also no responders that have documentation about their encryption management. More work is also needed to establish source code analysis (either manual or automated) to detect security defects. One responder has mentioned about using industry best practice security scan in their cloud environment networking, application and operating system layers. Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) is used by one of the responders to put requirements on the way users utilize the cloud infrastructure and services and this is a preferred approach to smoothen the interaction between users and service providers. If a mechanism is also added to enforce and monitor the compliance of users to the AUP, it will give the cloud infrastructure as well as other users' and tenants from being affected by malicious users or users whose credentials are compromised.

In addition to the questionnaire we put our focus on major security threats to cloud infrastructure that can possibly materialize in the cloud infrastructure within glenna. The CSA has done some concrete tasks with respect to identifying measures required to deal with various treats to cloud infrastructure and we mapped the possible threats to Glenna with measures required to mitigate with them and we advise the cloud service providers to consider those identified measures in order to secure their cloud and related IT infrastructure. In the next section we briefly discuss about the required measures which CSA refer them as Cloud Control Matrix (CCM)


Cloud Control Matrix
*************

The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA), which is one of the organizations that are working towards secure and resilient cloud services for organizations and for individual users that use cloud services in their day-to-day activities. The activities of CSA also include guiding cloud service providers to offer their services and solutions in a way that is compliant to different international and local standards and at the same time satisfy additional needs of cloud service customers and users. 

One of the working groups at CSA produced “Cloud Control Matrix (CCM)” which is designed to provide fundamental security principles to guide cloud vendors and to assist prospective cloud customers in assessing the overall security risk of a cloud provider. This makes it an interesting work and a potential input for Glenna; as Glenna comprises stakeholders that are both cloud service providers as well as customers. One of the most useful aspects of the CCM is that it is mapped to many other major industry standards, controls and frameworks [https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/group/cloud-controls-matrix//] - 

* HIPAA and HITECH Act
* ISO/IEC 27001-2005
* NIST SP800-53 R3
* PCI DSS 2.0
* Generally Accepted Privacy Principles, or GAPP
* Jericho Forum
* FedRAMP

Based on the work of CSA and their documentation, one can easily map a given control from CCM to the controls of all of the above standards and frameworks. The CCM gives a detailed explanation of security concepts and principles by categorizing them in groups. The first version of CCM (V1.1) was published in 2010 and it comprises 98 controls within 10 groups. The last version of CCM (V.3.0.1), which is published in 2014, comprises 133 controls grouped under 16 domains. The domains cover a large variety of security principles and concepts that can address security related issues in cloud computing. 

1. Application and Interface Security (AIS)
2. Audit Assurance and Compliance (AAC)
3. Business Continuity and Management and Operational Resilience (BCR)
4. Change Control and Configuration Management (CCM)
5. Data Security and Information Lifecycle Management (DSI)
6. Datacenter Security (DSC)
7. Encryption and Key Management (EKM)
8. Governance and Risk Management (GRM)
9. Human Resource Security (HRS)
10. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
11. Infrastructure and Virtualization (IVS)
12. Interoperability and Portability (IPY)
13. Mobile Security (MOS)
14. Security Incident Management, E-Disc and Cloud Forensics (SEF)
15. Supply Chain Management, Transparency and Accountability (STA)
16. Threat and Vulnerability Management (TVM) 

Identifying Required Controls
**************************************

The higher number of controls included in CCM makes it applicable in various cloud service provisions and application domains. For cloud service providers, it´s not a requirement to comply with all the controls and it might not also be feasible. But one can find applicable controls based on the security needs and risks associated with the target cloud service. One approach to identify the required controls is by using Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ). The CAIQ is a set of questions a cloud consumer and cloud auditor may wish to ask of a cloud provider. It provides a series of “yes” or “no” controls assertion questions, which can then be tailored to suit each unique cloud customer´s evidentiary requirements [https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/group/consensus-assessments/]. However, in Glenna the cloud service provider and the consumer are working as partners and with interchangeable roles (not in a formal client and vendor service provision model). Some of the services are also already live in production and inducing additional security requirements from clients to the vendors may not be feasible. 
We suggest the use of another requirement identification that can make the cloud service provision secure and by at the same time satisfying common security requirements from the main users. The method we found feasible is the use of common threats on cloud computing as a base to identify the most important controls from the CCM. Even if users within Glenna don't make the selection controls directly, there is an acceptable level of certainty that the users need shall be addressed by addressing the common security threats. 

The CSA has identified “The Notorious Nine: Cloud Computing Top Threats” in 2013 and gave suggestions on which cloud controls can help to mitigate with these common and critical threats. Basing the control selection on these can help us address the common security issues that shall arise on the infrastructures of the cloud service providers within Glenna.

The Notorious Nine Cloud Computing Top Threats are [https://downloads.cloudsecurityalliance.org/initiatives/top_threats/The_Notorious_Nine_Cloud_Computing_Top_Threats_in_2013.pdf] –

1. Data Breaches
2. Data Loss
3. Account Hijacking
4. Insecure APIs 
5. Denial of Service
6. Malicious Insiders
7. Abuse of Cloud Services
8. Insufficient Due Diligence
9. Shared Technology Issues

These are the top threats that materialized on cloud infrastructures and implementing controls against these threats can help to secure a cloud infrastructure from future similar and potential incidents or attacks. 

The controls for each threat are identified from the CCM V 1.0 and V 3.0.1. At the time of the publication of the top threats, the available CCM version was V 1.0 and CSA has suggested controls from the list of controls in version 1.0. At the time of this writing, the latest CCM version is (V 3.0.1) and in order to entertain these latest measures in our project, we made mapping of those controls from V 1.0 (suggested to the Top Cloud Computing Threats) to the controls in CCM version 3.0.1. 

Each control in the CCM is identified by a unique ID that comprises the category of the control (three alphabets for controls in version 3.01.1 and two alphabets in V 1.0) and a number. For instance Identity & Access Management controls are identified by IAM followed by a number (e.g. IAM-01) in CCM V 3.0.1. On the other hand, V 1.0 refers "Security Architecture - User ID Credentials" as SA followed by a number (e.g. SA-01).

In the following section we listed the top nine cloud computing threats and the controls that are suggested for each threat. For ease of reference we put the ID of the control from v 3.0.1 followed by the id of a similar control in the previous version (which is put in bracket). As shown below for each threat there is a list of controls that one can use to mitigate with. For Threat 1 for instance there are 11 suggested controls. All required controls for the nine notorious cloud security threats are listed in the section below. Please note that, controls that are described in one threat will not be described again in another threat to avoid repetition.

**TVM-02 (IS-20): Threat and Vulnerability Management Vulnerability / Patch Management**

**Description:** Policies and procedures shall be established, and supporting processes and technical measures implemented, for timely detection of vulnerabilities within organizationally-owned or managed applications, infrastructure network and system components (e.g. network vulnerability assessment, penetration testing) to ensure the efficiency of implemented security controls. A risk-based model for prioritizing remediation of identified vulnerabilities shall be used. Changes shall be managed through a change management process for all vendor-supplied patches, configuration changes, or changes to the organization's internally developed software. Upon request, the provider informs customer (tenant) of policies and procedures and identfied weaknesses especially if customer (tenant) data is used as part the service and/or customer (tenant) has some shared responsibility over implementation of control.

**IVS-09 (SA-11): Infrastructure & Virtualization Security Segmentation **

**Description:** Multi-tenant organizationally-owned or managed (physical and virtual) applications, and infrastructure system and network components, shall be designed, developed, deployed and configured such that provider and customer (tenant) user access is appropriately segmented from other tenant users, based on the following considerations:

* Established policies and procedures
* Isolation of business critical assets and/or sensitive user data, and sessions that mandate stronger internal controls and high levels of assurance
* Compliance with legal, statutory and regulatory compliance obligations
